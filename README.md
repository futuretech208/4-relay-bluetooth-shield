This code is written for my home pump automation which has a panel with ON switch and OFF switch, thus users have to customize it for their applications.
the pump panel contains the ON switch with 2 elements which are N/O. and OFF switch with 1 element which is N/C.
2 relays are engaged simultaneously for ON and 1 relay for OFF. bluetooth module HC 05 or 06 can be used
Ultrasound sensor for Arduino is used for sensing water level and turning off the pumps correspondingly
Code is well tested and the unit I hve made is in operation at my home since January 2017.

the app development is done in MIT app inventor.

All the best for your projects using this board..
